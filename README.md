## 📊 Project Title: Student Performance Analysis using Multiple Linear Regression

### 📝 Project Description:

This project uses **Multiple Linear Regression** to analyze and predict student performance based on academic, personal, and behavioral factors. By processing a dataset of student attributes like study hours, sleep duration, previous academic scores, and extracurricular activities, the model aims to forecast the **Performance Index** of students. This can help in identifying areas for improvement and guiding academic strategies.

### ✅ Key Features:

- **Multivariate Data Handling**  
  Considers various real-world attributes influencing student success.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Includes encoding, scaling, and cleaning for optimal model input.

- **Correlation Analysis**  
  Determines the most impactful features on student performance.

- **Model Evaluation Metrics**  
  Uses **R² Score** and **MAE** for model performance insights.

- **Visual Insights**  
  Includes heatmaps and scatter plots to observe relationships.

---

### 📁 Dataset:

- The dataset used is: **`Student_Performance.csv`**
- Contains attributes like:
  - Study Hours  
  - Sleep Time  
  - Previous Scores  
  - Extracurricular Activities  
  - Sample Question Papers Practiced  
  - Performance Index (Target)

---

### 📈 Workflow Summary:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded dataset using Pandas  
   - Encoded categorical features (e.g., activities)  
   - Visualized trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Created heatmap  
   - Selected features with correlation > 0.2 with Performance Index

3. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Normalized features using MinMaxScaler

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained a Linear Regression model (Scikit-learn)  
   - Evaluated using:
     - **R² Score**  
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

---

### 📊 Visualizations:

- **📍 Scatter Plots** – Feature vs Performance Index  
- **🔥 Correlation Heatmap** – Showcasing feature importance visually

---

### 🧪 Results:

- **R² Score:** _Varies based on train-test split_  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** _Dependent on dataset sample_

---

### 🔮 Future Enhancements:

- Try **Polynomial Regression** or **Random Forest** for improved accuracy  
- Add more features like **socioeconomic factors**, **family background**, etc.  
- Deploy as a web app using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
